<h2><strong>Female inventors in Switzerland–still a lot of unused potential left</strong></h2>

<p><strong>It was only 50 years ago when Switzerland finally introduced the legal right for women to vote. Since then, women have continued fighting for gender equality and equal representation in politics, civil society, and the economy. Progress has been made but has generally taken a long time. Women remain underrepresented in many fields and this is especially the case in some domains of the labor market. </strong></p>
<p>According to the <a href = https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/bei-den-100-groessten-schweizer-arbeitgebern-gibt-es-vier-weibliche-ceo-und-genauso-viele-maennliche-die-urs-heissen-ld.1395202?reduced=true target = “_blank”>NZZ</a>, only 4 of the 100 largest Swiss employers had a female CEO in 2018, and a <a href = https://business-monitor.ch/de/reports/gender-equality-2019 target = “_blank”>Business Monitor</a> survey found that the female share in management positions of Swiss companies was only 23.9 percent in 2019. Another domain where women still tend to be underrepresented is in companies’ innovative activities. For example, the <a href = https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/OCE-DH-Progress-Potential-2020.pdf target = “_blank”> United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)</a> recently reported that the share of patents with at least one female inventor was 21.9 percent in 2019. Although this share has constantly increased since the 1980s, women clearly continue to be underrepresented in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>This is obviously problematic regarding equal gender representation as such, but can it also be of concern beyond this consideration? As innovations and technical inventions are the main drivers of growth and prosperity in the long run, there might be several economic reasons why the gender bias may be harmful. First, if there are more women who could in principle be scientists and engineers than those currently involved in innovative activities, the economy is most probably not able to utilize the skills of its domestic workforce in an optimal way. Stated differently, if more women could be attracted for R&amp;D careers, this could result in more innovation and growth (<a href = https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964782 target = “_blank”>Bedee et al., 2011</a>). Second, mixed teams simply tend to perform better. This has been shown for more diverse management (<a href = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.1955?casa_token=yOShOsPuKLAAAAAA%3ALy83ED8GcfSsa6l6gguIlO4d0z53f17_iP72EV4Izv0NdeBcAsmAFnXRlkvTZ7UPQ-S3IOJn4QZqaSaFTg target = “_blank”>Dezsoe &amp; Gaddis Ross, 2012</a>) and research teams (<a href = https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1363919620500619 target = “_blank”>Wikhamn &amp; Wikhamn, 2020</a>) alike. Hence, the economic advantages of increasing the share of female inventors are potentially quite straightforward: More female inventors may not only increase the <em>quantity</em> of innovations, but also improve their overall <em>quality</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some countries have been more successful than others in achieving higher levels of female participation in R&amp;D. This is shown in Figure 1. The dynamic graph is based on patent data from the <a href = https://www.uspto.gov/ target = “_blank”> United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)</a> and allows to compare countries over a long period of time with regard to their share of female patent inventors.</p>

<p><br> At the beginning of the 1980s the rate of female inventors has been very low in almost all countries. But it was especially low for Switzerland where less than two out of 100 inventors of Swiss patents published at the USPTO were women. Female representation in Switzerland has improved somewhat over the last 40 years, but in 2018 still only 9 out of 100 Swiss patent inventors are women.</p>
<div class="bloc_div">
<blockquote>
<strong><em>Only 9 out of 100 Swiss patent inventors are women</em></strong>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This puts Switzerland somewhere in the lower midfield in a country-comparison. Over time, the female shares of inventors increased steadily in most countries, but it never got close to an equal representation of men and women in any country. At the same time, there are a lot of differences among countries: For example, in 2018 still less than 7 out of 100 German inventors were women. In turn, Asian countries and territories such as Hong-Kong, South Korea and Taiwan had rather high rates of around 20 women per 100 inventors.</p>
<p>What could be possible reasons for these low female shares? One reason simply is that not so many women graduate in fields like Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (so-called STEM fields) which is generally a precondition to become an inventor. Accordingly, the overall supply of potential female inventors is rather low. Another point could be that among female graduates in STEM fields, not so many become inventors. This, in turn, would imply that inventor careers are less attractive for women compared to men. Figure 2 allows to investigate both of these channels. We use the same USPTO data as before to calculate female inventor shares (stated on the vertical y-axis states) and put it in relation to data from the <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=79486#" target="_blank">OECD</a> on female STEM graduate shares (stated on the horizontal x-axis). Due to data availability, we use information for the period 2005-2015 and aggregate the data of this 10-year period to smooth out yearly fluctuations. Every point in Figure 2 represents a country and we plotted the point for Switzerland red for better visibility.</p>

<p>The average share of female STEM graduates across all considered countries is 36 percent, which confirms the well-known underrepresentation of women in these fields. However, it is interesting to note that the shares vary considerably across countries. For example, Eastern and Southern European countries tend to have higher female graduate shares (e.g. Poland, Estonia, Italy, or Greece). Therefore, it might well be possible for other countries to increase their female graduate shares in STEM. Even more striking is that every country in our sample is below the dashed diagonal line (see the green dots in the graph). This diagonal line shows the female inventor shares that could be achieved if countries would exactly employ the same proportion of women in R&amp;D as they train through their education systems. Take Switzerland for example: 28.5 percent of all students who graduated in STEM fields between 2005 and 2015 were women. However, Switzerland’s female inventor share was only 8.6 percent for the same period. Hence, only a very disproportional share of Swiss female STEM graduates pursues inventor careers. Now, since all countries are located below the diagonal line, the share of female patent inventors is <em>lower</em> than the share of female STEM graduates in <em>every</em> country. Spoken differently, not only are there relatively few female STEM graduates in many countries, but those women who chose to study a STEM field are less likely to end up in an R&amp;D career compared to their male peers in general. And the farther away a country is positioned from the diagonal line, the more pronounced is this imbalance. <br></p>

<p>Noticeable, Japan and Korea are relatively far to the left, that is closer to the diagonal line, suggesting that these countries are relatively more successful in motivating female STEM graduates to become inventors. However, there are some caveats to this argument. As you can see, both countries have rather low female inventor shares in the first place. This could mean that there is just stronger self-selection. That is to say, among their lower numbers of female graduates there are more who absolutely want to become inventors than in other countries. Another argument might be that the observed advantage of these countries could be driven by country-specific industry specialization. Think of it this way: If there are some technology areas where women inventors are more adequately represented (for example Chemistry compared to Mechanical Engineering), a country that specializes in such technology areas might have a higher overall female share. But this higher overall share would not be due to some successful policy framework in this country, but rather to industry specialization.</p>
<p>Figure 3 allows us to examine the latter caveat by selecting a technology area in the slider panel. After selecting a given technology area, the graph states female inventor shares of patents exclusively from this technology area across countries. Observing these country-level differences in female inventor shares are generally less pronounced within the same technology area. For example, countries are more closely positioned to each other along the y-axis in the fields “Mechanical Engineering” or “Electrical Engineering”. Accordingly, technological specialization seems to be one good explanation of differences across countries. However, substantial gaps remain between these countries (e.g. in “Chemistry”) and Korea and Japan are always the countries that are most closely located to the left, that is towards the diagonal 45-degree line. This suggests that beyond industry characteristics, policies and cultural norms are also important.</p>
<p>Let us now switch back to the female inventor shares in the overall economy. Note that countries located in the upper right of Figure 3 are the best performing ones, as they have both a relatively high share of female STEM graduates and female inventors. This is especially the case for Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, or Spain. Countries in the upper left don’t have a high share of female STEM graduates but at least make good use of their potential towards new inventions and innovations. In this regard, South Korea is successful, but also France and Belgium are doing better relative to other countries.</p>
<div class="bloc_div">
<blockquote>
<strong><em>Switzerland and all other German-speaking countries perform most poorly. </em></strong>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In contrast, countries in the lower left perform most poorly. Remarkably, Switzerland and all other German-speaking countries are located in this area. There can be several possible reasons for this, ranging from cultural peculiarities to less family-friendly work environments or more attractive outside options for female STEM graduates (for example more decent salaries in more family friendly occupations such as teachers or public servants).</p>

<h3><strong>What can be done?</strong></h3>
<p>In short, Switzerland does not perform well compared to other countries and there seems to be room for improvement. On the one hand, the female graduate share in STEM fields is low.

Swiss policy-making, academia and the business world should thus foster existing projects (for example <a href = https://www.tecladies.ch/de/blog/ target = “_blank”>Swiss TecLadies</a> and <a href = https://girlscancode.ch target = “_blank”>Girls Can Code</a>, or initiatives from <a href = https://ictswitzerland.ch/publikationen/positionspapier-mehr-frauen-in-die-informatik// target = “_blank”>ICT Switzerland</a>, <a href = https://www.epfl.ch/education/education-and-science-outreach/de/jugendliche/mint-workshops/internet-code-fur-madchen/ target = “_blank”>EPFL</a> or <a herf=https://www.nationalerzukunftstag.ch/de/maedchen/spezialprojekte/maedchen-technik-los/ target = “_blank”>Zukunftstag</a>) and tackle ongoing challenges more intensively.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Switzerland’s conversion rate from STEM graduates to inventors is also relatively low. Increasing this rate could likely be addressed more directly by policymakers. One important aspect may be the compatibility of family and career (<a href = https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/10/4182.full.pdf target = “_blank”>Cech &amp; Blair-Loy, 2019</a>). In R&amp;D related occupations, this might be particularly challenging today, for example because long lab work hours are often the case. Therefore, investments and more flexible models in child day care could be an important channel to consider. From an industry perspective, a shift towards enabling more part-time work could be promising to increase the attractiveness of R&amp;D careers for female STEM graduates (<a href = https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-27242010000100011&script=sci_arttext&tlng=n target = “_blank”>Mavriplis et al., 2010</a>). More generally, adaptions in the Swiss tax system could be important as well (<a href = https://www.ecoplan.ch/download/aib_sb_de.pdf target = “_blank”>Ecoplan, 2019</a>).</p>

<p>To sum up, policies in different areas are important channels to raise women participation in inventive activities. As the Swiss economy requires constantly new technical innovations, new ideas and improved processes to remain one of the leading innovation hubs in the world, making good use of the skill potential of its workforce is key for Switzerland’s future prosperity. Hence, there is a strong case to push policies aimed at increasing the attractiveness of R&amp;D careers for women.</p>
